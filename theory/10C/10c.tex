    \item $\log{a_1} + \log{a_2} + \cdots + \log{a_n} + \log{S}$
    \item 
    Suppose each $a_i$ is $O(2^n)$ and $S$ is also $O(2^n)$; the input size is $O(n^2)$\\
    When $S = O(n^9)$, the running time is polynomial in the input size
    \item D-Fact-1 can be solved in polynomial time as it is same as primality testing
    \item 
    D-Fact-2 is at least as hard as D-Fact-1\\
    D-Fact-2 ``captures'' D-Fact-1 (by appropriately setting x, y)
    \item 
    Run D-Fact-2 on $(2, \sqrt{M})$. If it returns false, there is no factorization.\\
    Otherwise, let $x$ and $y$ equal 2 and $\sqrt{M}$ respectively.\\
    While $x < y$, run D-Fact-2 on both halves of the range $[x,y]$, then set $x, y$ equal to whichever range returned true (arbitrarily if both returned true).\\
    Return $x$.

    We run D-Fact-2 $\log{\sqrt{M}}$ times, which is $O(n^2 \log{\sqrt{M}})$.\\
    Since $M$ is $O(2^n)$ (since it's n-bit), this reduces to $O(n^2 * \frac{1}{2} \log{2^n}) = O(n^2 * \frac{1}{2} * n * \log{2}) = O(n^3)$.
